Q1: What is a nested loop?
A1:
A nested loop is a loop that occurs within another loop. The synthax as below:

for [first iterating variable] in [outer loop]: # Outer loop
    [do something]  # Optional
    for [second iterating variable] in [nested loop]:   # Nested loop
        [do something]

The program first encounters the outer loop, executing its first iteration. This first
iteration triggers the inner, nested loop, which then runs to completion. Then the program 
returns back to the top of the outer loop, completing the second iteration and again 
triggering the nested loop. Again, the nested loop runs to completion, and the program 
returns back to the top of the outer loop until the sequence is complete or a break or 
other statement disrupts the process.

Q2: Which kind of loop is based on a conditional statement: while loops or for loops?
A2: While loop.

Q3: When you want to iterate a specific number of times, would you typically use a while loop or a
for loop?
A3: For loop

Q4: Is it possible to loop through a string one letter at a time? What is the example given in the article?
A4: Yes. Example given in the article as below:

sammy = 'Sammy'

for letter in sammy:
   print(letter)

The output will looks like below:
Output
S
a
m
m
y

Q5: Extrapolate from what you learned in the articles: Do you think a for loop be nested inside a
while loop? Why or why not?
A5:
Yes it is doable. Because in nested loop like "for" loop inside a "while" loop, each loop, i.e. "for" loop will
be executed on its own (independently) until its iteration or looping completed then it will return to the external loop which in 
this case is "while" loop. The external "while" loop will then got repeated until its conditional statement
return False. In this case, everytime the "while" loop executed because the conditional statement still return
True, the nested "for" loop inside it will get iterated again.
